<p><strong>Deadline: Thursday, October 19th, 2023 by 11:59 PM PDT</strong></p>

<div class="md-content">

    <p>This is a group project; you can work in a team of size at most two and submit one
      project per team. You are not required to work with the same partner on every project.
      You and your partner should collaborate closely on each part.</p>

    <p>You have three late days that you may use to turn in work past the
      deadline over the entire quarter. A late day is a contiguous 24-hour
      period. Both you and your partner will be charged for every late day
      that you use, and you both must have late days to use them. These
      late days are intended to cover your extension needs for usual
      circumstances: brief illness, busy with other classes, interviews,
      travel, extracurricular conflicts, and so on. You do not need to ask
      permission to use a late day.</p>

    <p>The code and other answers you submit must be entirely your team's
      own work. You may discuss the conceptualization of the project and the
      meaning of the questions, but you may not look at any part of someone
      else's solution or collaborate with anyone other than your
      partner. You may consult published references, provided that you
      appropriately cite them (e.g., with program comments).</p>

    <p>Solutions must be submitted to Gradescope.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with the setup that will be used for future
assignments, such as the use of a virtual machine and the included turn-in script, as well as the
basics of working with gdb and writing programs in x86 assembly.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To complete this assignment, you will be provided with a VirtualBox VM pre-populated with the
assignment files.</p>
<h3 id="vm-image">VM Image</h3>
<p>In order to match the environment in which your submission will be graded, all work for this
assignment must be done on the VirtualBox VM we provide, named <code>pa1box</code>. You can download the VM
image <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LDLZmgqZPTE4bhTqloIZXHKHz-9egwsd/view"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The VM is configured with two users: <code>student</code>, with password <code>hacktheplanet</code>; and <code>root</code>, with
password <code>hackallthethings</code>. The VM is configured with SSH on port 2222. Please note that SSH is
disabled for <code>root</code>, so you can only SSH in as the <code>student</code> user. You can still log in as <code>root</code>
using <code>su</code> or by logging into the VM directly.</p>
<p>To SSH into the VM:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-selector-tag">ssh</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">-p</span> 2222 <span class="hljs-selector-tag">student</span>@<span class="hljs-keyword">127</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">0</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">0</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">1</span>
</code></pre><p>To copy files from your computer to the VM:</p>
<pre><code>scp -P <span class="hljs-number">2222</span> -r /path/to/files/ student<span class="hljs-variable">@127</span>.<span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-symbol">:/home/student</span>

<p>
    Alice is a security engineer in a company called Security4All. She felt 
    that their programs are running a bit weird recently. After doing some
    research, she suspect that the C compiler they are using might have
    been backdoored. It is a huge issue because a compromised compiler
    will potentially defeat all security mechanism they implemented in a
    higher level language. Now Alice heard that you have experience with
    gdb in some classes and asks for your help to learn the behavior of a
    program using gdb.
</p>

<p>Files for this sub-assignment are located in the <code>gdb</code> subdirectory of the <code>student</code> user's home
directory in the VM image; that is, <code>/home/student/gdb</code>. SSH into the VM and <code>cd</code> into that
directory to begin working on it.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>gdb</code> directory, you'll find <code>fib.c</code>, a C program demonstrating the Fibonacci sequence;
a <code>Makefile</code>; and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse127-a/resources/hw1.txt">hw1.txt</a>, in which you'll record your responses to the questions below. The
first step is to compile <code>fib</code> by running <code>make</code> on the command line.</p>
<p>To run the <code>fib</code> executable in GDB, run <code>gdb fib</code>.
I recommend the following workflow in GDB:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Starting.</strong> Set breakpoints that you can later use for analysis:<ul>
<li><code>b foo</code> — break at function <code>foo</code></li>
<li><code>b *0x08048489</code> — break at the instruction at address 0x08048489</li>
<li><code>r</code> — run the executable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyzing.</strong> Examine memory, registers, etc; disassemble code; show stack frames, backtrace,
etc; and more:<ul>
<li><code>disas foo</code> — disassemble function <code>foo</code></li>
<li><code>i r</code> — view registers</li>
<li><code>where</code> — view stack frames</li>
<li><code>x &lt;loc&gt;</code> — examine memory</li>
<li><code>x $eip</code> — examine current instruction pointer</li>
<li><code>x /10x $esp</code> — examine 10 words at top of stack</li>
<li><code>x /10x buf</code> — examine 10 words in <code>buf</code></li>
<li><code>x /10i $eip</code> — examine 10 instructions starting at instruction pointer</li>
<li><code>x /10i foo</code> — examine 10 instructions starting at <code>foo</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Continuing.</strong> Continue analysis:<ul>
<li><code>c</code> — continue execution until next breakpoint/watchpoint</li>
<li><code>si</code> — step to the next instruction</li>
<li><code>s</code> — step to the next line of source code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this is only a cursory overview of GDB; much more info is available from online
resources.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-echo-in-x86-10-pts-">Part 2: <code>echo</code> in x86 <em>(10 pts)</em></h2>
<p>
  Bob is a developer at Security4All. He received an internal warning
  that the compiler might be compromised. However, not being able to use
  a compiler blocks the development of their project that has to be released in a week.
  While the security team is still investigating the compiler, Bob
  decides to finish up their development using raw assembly. However,
  it's been five years since Bob took his undergrad class about assembly,
  so Bob needs you help to write a simple x86 assembly program to
  refresh the knowledge.
</p>
<p>Files for this sub-assignment are located in the <code>x86</code> subdirectory of the <code>student</code> user's home
directory in the VM image; that is, <code>/home/student/x86</code>. SSH into the VM and <code>cd</code> into that
directory to begin working on it.</p>
<p>For this part, you will be implementing a simplified version of the familiar <code>echo</code> command, using
raw x86 assembly code. The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with writing programs
directly in x86.</p>
<p>Your <code>echo</code> command must behave as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When run with a single command line argument (e.g., <code>./echo Hello</code>):<ol>
<li>Prints that argument back to the console's standard output (stdout).</li>
<li>Prints a trailing newline (<code>\n</code>).</li>
<li>Exits with code 0.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When run with too few command line arguments (e.g., <code>./echo</code>) or too many (e.g., <code>./echo Hello
World</code>):<ol>
<li>Prints <em>exactly</em> the error message <code>This command expects exactly one argument.</code> —
followed by a trailing newline (<code>\n</code>) — to the console's standard <em>error</em> (stderr).</li>
<li>Exits with code 1.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your code should be written in the file <code>echo.s</code> inside the <code>x86</code> directory. A heavily-commented
example <code>echo.s</code> is provided, which simply prints the message <code>Hello World</code> (followed by a trailing
newline) to stdout. Your job is to modify this program to meet the specification for <code>echo</code> above.</p>
<p>A <code>Makefile</code> is included, so you can build the <code>echo</code> binary by running <code>make</code> from the command line.</p>

<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>Submit <code>echo.s</code> to "PA1: x86 echo" on Gradescope.</p>

<h3 id="helpful-hints">Helpful Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a Linux program, stdout is file descriptor number 1 and stderr is number 2.</li>
<li>Linux programs start with <code>argc</code> at the top of the stack, accessible at <code>0(%esp)</code> from
x86-assembly programs. Below it is <code>argv</code>, the array of pointers to <em>(null-terminated)</em> strings
passed into the program as arguments. So <code>argv[0]</code> can be accessed from x86-assembly programs at
<code>4(%esp)</code>, <code>argv[1]</code> at <code>8(%esp)</code>, <code>argv[2]</code> at <code>12(%esp)</code>, and so on.</li>
<li><code>argv[0]</code> is the name of the program executed, <em>not</em> the first argument, which is <code>argv[1]</code> if
supplied (or <code>8(%esp)</code> for our purposes). Then <code>argc</code> (or <code>0(%esp)</code>) will be 1 if the program was
not passed any arguments, 2 if it was passed 1 argument, and so on.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#x86-32_bit">table of Linux system calls</a> may come in handy.</li>
<li>For people with AMD CPUs, you may find that your VMs don't boot unless you boot with sysvinit instead of systemd. This is normal, and will not affect your assignment. </li>
</ul>

<h3>M1 machines</h3>
<p>
VirtualBox doesn't work on M1 machines. To use the vm image on M1 machines, you will have to install <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a> and run the vm with it.
</p>        

<code>
brew install qemu<br><br>
qemu-system-x86_64 \<br>
    -cpu qemu64 \<br>
    -m 4096 \<br>
    -device e1000,netdev=net0,mac=08:00:27:D3:23:52 \<br>
    -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \<br>
    -drive file=/Path/to/pa1box/pa1box-disk1.vmdk
</code>

<p>
User and ssh settings are the same as using VirtualBox.
